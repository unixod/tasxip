TasXIP is cross-platform tool, that can be builded anywhere (win, *nix).

### Requirements ###

Qt4 development libraries

### Building ###

1. Make and change to a new directory to do the builds in.
2. Generate Makefiles for target platform, using cmake or qmake.
3. Type: "make".

For example:
*nix
	$ mkdir tasxip-build
	$ cd tasxip-build
	$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../tasxip
	$ make
win
	:> ..same as above...
	:> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ../tasxip
	:> nmake

This will now keep all generates files seperate from the maintained source code.
